## First TypeScript+React experiance

The main goal of this project was to practice in the Typescript language in conjunction with the React library.
Also, on the example of this project, I wanted to face and show the problem of prop drilling. In the future, it is
planned to make a second version, which will use a different approach, namely the Context API or work with the Redux
state manager
